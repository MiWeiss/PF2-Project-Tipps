## Common Problems and Countermeasures

#### :hankey: The project is not completed at the time of submission. :bulb: Prioritize features [-> minimal first principle](./minimal_first)

#### :hankey: At the time of (milestone or final) submission, the project is in an invalid state :bulb: feature branches  [ -> mini git tutorial](./mini_sections/simple_git.md) 

#### :hankey: One of the teammates does not contribute to the project. :bulb: Talk to the TA or lecturer asap.

#### :hankey: There's a bug that is driving me crazy :bulb: That's life :-) [-> debugging tips](./mini_sections/debugging_starter.md)

#### :hankey: There's a checkstyle error I cannot fix. :bulb: [-> explain in a comment](./mini_sections/explanantion_comments.md)
 
#### :hankey: There's a feature I cannot implement. :bulb: [-> mock functionality](./mini_sections/mocking.md)

#### :hankey: I forgot to save my project. It's all gone. :bulb: git push frequently [-> mini git tutorial](./mini_sections/simple_git.md)

#### :hankey: The pressure is getting too much. :bulb: [-> Start early, minimal first, get help!](./mini_sections/stress.md)





## How to get a good grade?
The following things will help you to improve your grades (loosely ordered in dicreasing order of priority).

#### :+1: :+1: :+1: :exclamation: Be fair (no plagiarism, no late submission) 
Do not copy any code from anywhere. 
If you consulted only references (e.g. StackOverflow) to solve a problem, make sure you fully understand and re-write the solution
yourself (instead of copying). Also add appropriate referencing to your solution.

#### :+1: :+1: :+1: Code Compiles without Errors
If your code does not compile, we cannot run it and won't be able to give you any points for any of the cool stuff you implemented.

#### :+1: :+1: :+1: Happy Path Functionality
Make sure at least one minimal happy path works. [-> minimal first principle](./minimal_first)

#### :+1: :+1: Code Documentation and Project Readme

#### :+1: :+1: Reasonable Software Design Choices

#### :+1: :+1: High test coverage with meaningful tests

#### :+1: :+1: No code duplication where reasonably avoidable

#### :+1: :+1: No checkstyle errors or compiler warnings

#### :+1: :+1: Edge-Case functionality for main features

#### :+1: Additional Functionality (Top GUI, Easter Eggs, Feature Extensions)
