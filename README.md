## How to be efficient and successful in my Student Programming Project?

### Common Problems and Countermeasures

#### :hankey: The project is not completed at the time of submission.

#### :hankey: At the time of (milestone or final) submission, the project is in an invalid state, as there's active work on a new feature.

#### :hankey: One of the teammates does not contribute to the project.

#### :hankey: There's a bug I cannot fix.

#### :hankey: There's a checkstyle error I cannot fix.
 
#### :hankey: There's a feature I cannot implement.

#### :hankey: I forgot to save my project. It's all gone.


#### :hankey: The pressure is getting too much.
Make sure to **start early**: Don't do most of the workload just before the deadline. Besides obvious advantages,
this allows you to take a timeout if needed while still being able to submit in time. 
Additionally, TAs are more likely to be able to help you if you contact them early.

It also helps if to apply a **minimal functionality first** principle [-> Read this](./minimal_first.md). 
This way, you will soon have your project in a submittable state. 
If stress now suddenly gets too much, you can always submit and still collect important partial points.

Lastly, make sure to get help if everything gets too much. 
Contact friends, family or the University
